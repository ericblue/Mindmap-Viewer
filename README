This application/service will allow users to take a variety of mind map formats, and display the maps inside a browser using a Java 
applet or Flash viewer. This means that maps can now be embedded directly into personal sites, wikis, or blogs using simple 
Javascript and iframes, and no need for your audience to have your specific mind mapping software in order to view your map!

The application essentially does the following:

* Downloads the mindmap at the provided URL (previously converted maps will be cached)
* Extract/convert the .mmap file to XML
* Translate to the FreeMind .mm format using XSL
* Embed or launch using the FreeMind Java Applet or Flash Viewer
